# Smart-Parking-System
Smart parking system (SPS) consists of three components: 1) The license plate recognition system 2) Database management system (DBMS) 3) Website for the (SPS) system
The smart parking system is a system that allows a person to park his vehicle without human intervention where the (SPS) calculates the bill cost of vehicle parking, SPS is used in smart cities such as Dubai, malaysia...etc. The license plate recognition system is the main component of the SPS system where the license plate recognition takes an image of a vehicle and recognizes the plate number using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). The database management system (DBMS) is the storage for the bills records where a billing record contains a plate number of a vehicle, the bill cost for parking...etc. The website of SPS system is used to create a park in the smart city, create an account for the administrator of the created park, show the available parking places in a park, show basic statistics about a park for example number of vehicles that are parking in a month...etc. The website and the database will be uploaded later. In order to understand the details of the SPS system, read the SPS project thesis.
